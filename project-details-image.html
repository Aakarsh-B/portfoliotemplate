                <h2>Daily UI</h2>
				
				<h4>Brief</h4>
                <p>There was a challenge hosted by <a href="https://dailyui.co">dailyui.co</a>. The challenge was to create 100 UI Designs in 100 Days. It was a very pleasant and sometimes tiring work, given the fact that I have to create something new everyday.</p>

				<h4>Results</h4>
                <p>Succesfully created 30+ designs and currently counting. I create something new everyday and try and post them on either dribbble or Behance. Certainly have a few works pending, but I am amped to complete this amazing feat!</p>
